        Program History
      </h1>
      <p>
        The Department of Electronics and Computer Engineering (DECE) is one of the largest departments in the Gokongwei
        College of Engineering at De La Salle University. Currently, the department has twenty-six academic personnel,
        one non-academic personnel, and eight support personnel providing technical, professional and administrative
        services. Different laboratories have been established for each area of specialization. A number of specialized
        modern research equipment was acquired from the Department of Science and Technology through the Engineering and
        Science Education Program. The equipment is used by the personnel and students for research and development.

        The Research Center of the Department will also provide consultancy services to industry, it also conducts
        industrially relevant research. During the starting phase, the Center will identify research areas which have
        elements of research, service, and development. The results from the research in an identified area should be
        available as a service to our local industry. Aside from undertaking collaborative research projects with
        industry, the Research Center of the ECE department also aims to train industry-oriented researchers and
        engineers through seminars or short course training.
